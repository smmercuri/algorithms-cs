# algorithms-cs
Assignments and other code for Coursera courses Algorithms, Part I and Part II, taught by Kevin Wayne, Senior Lecturer and Robert Sedgewick, Professor.

This course covers essential algorithms and data structures, and mathematical analysis of their performance. This repository contains solutions to the assignments, and other interesting bits and pieces. It is coded in Java.

The code uses textbook libraries and implementations from the course. This is the algs4.jar library which can be found at [https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/)

Grades for assignments are as follows.
| Assignment  | Grade  |
|-------------|--------|
| percolation | 93/100 |
|   queues    | 87/100 |
|  mergesort  | 81/100 |
|  8 puzzle   | 94/100 |
|  Kd-trees   | 84/100 |
