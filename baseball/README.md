# Baseball Elimination using Flow Networks

A fairly unexpected application of finding the maximum flow of a flow network is in determining whether a baseball team has been mathematically eliminated. Consider the league table, where w[i], l[i], r[i] represents the number of wins, losses, remaining games respectively for team i, and g[i][j] represents the number of games remaining between team i and team i

i|team| w[i] | l[i] | r[i] | g[i][1] | g[i][2] |g[i][3]| 
0| Atlanta|83|71|8|-|1|6|1|
