# Queues

A queue is a standard data structure representing a collection of objects with a FIFO (first in first out) removal system, i.e. when we remove an item we remove the item that was *least* recently added. A stack, on the other hand, represents a collection of objects with a LIFO (last in first out) removal system which removes the item *most* recently added.

Here, we generalise these objects to produce a *Deque* data structure, which represents a collection of objects in which we may remove either the least recently or most recently added item. 

We also implement a *Randomized Queue* where the item removed is selected uniformly at random from the collection of objects.
